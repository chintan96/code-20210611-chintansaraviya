Run solution.py as "python3 solution.py"
Data will be extracted from input_data.json file which will be then processed by solution.py and a output_data.json file will be generated.

Run test.py as "python3 test.py"
test.py will determine if program works correctly or not. It will compare output data of input_data.json(assuming that it has its original content) to test_output_data.json.
